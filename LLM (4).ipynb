SBO/Sepsis:  High grade small bowel obstruction in imaging.\\nSBO was performed with the removal of 3 feet of necrotic small\\nbowel.  Within 12 hours of the procedure, the patient was noted\\nto be hypotensive and required aggressive hydration and a short\\ninterval of pressor support.   She was initally treated with\\nvanc/cipro/flagyl but there was concern for allergy to one of\\nthese medications and so the patient was switched to vanc/zosyn\\nfor coverage of abdominal flora.  Once patient was transferred\\nto floor (Stone 5), SBP's remained elevated 140 to 170's. Over\\nseveral days, her blood pressures stablized and returned back to\\nher baseline ranging between 100-110 systolic. She continues\\nwith IV Lopressor, and should be transistioned to oral Lopressor\\nonce tolerating oral medications.\\n.\\n# Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Pt was intubated for sugery but\\ncontinued to require up to POD#8.  Barriers to her immediate\\nextubation pulmonary edema in the setting of aggressive fluid\\nresusitaion and labile hypertension. The patients respiratory\\nstatus stabilized, and remained stable during her hospital\\ncourse.\\n.\\n# Anxiety:  Patient has significant anxiety at baseline and\\ntypically takes 2mg xanax every 8 hours at home.  While\\nintubated, the patient required versed and peri-extubation, was\\ntreated with haldol to minimize agitation. Once on the floor\\n([**Hospital Ward Name 1950**] 5), her she appeared somnolent with intermittent\\ndelirium & hallucinations. All Benzo's and Narcotics were held\\nfor 2-3 days. At this time, Psych was consulted for furhter\\nmanagement, and per the husband's request. The husband had been\\ngiving the patient xanax from home. This was discussed with him,\\nand stopped. Her delirium waxed and waned. Home xanax regimen\\nwas resumed per Psych recommendation. Currently, her mental\\nstatus has been much improved with mild confusion occurring\\novernight. She is easily re-oriented, and non-combative.\\n.\\n# ARF: Renal following. Multiple causes possible. Received IV\\ncontrast for CT scan on [**12-25**]. Also noted to have bilateral\\nhydonephrosis on CT scan, confirmed and unchanged on renal u/s\\non [**12-27**].\\n-Renal and urology services followed patient during admission.\\n-She was adequately volume rescuscitated, Creatinine was\\nfollowed with marked improvement back to baseline. Her urostomy\\nappliance was completely changed on [**2112-1-7**]. U/A C+S was sent\\non [**2112-1-6**] for slight elevation in WBC to 13. Culture with no\\ngrowth. UA-negative. Urine clear, yellow.\\n.\\n# ID: She will continue with another 3 days of IV Vanco and\\nZosyn for a total of 10days to treat post-op fever which\\noccurred in the ICU. WBC slightly elevated for past few days\\nfrom 13-14. Patient does not exhibit any other symptoms of\\ninfection. Vitals are stable. Cognitive status improved, and\\nabdominal incision without signs of infection.\\n.\\n# Skin: Midline abdominal incision OTA with staples. Occasional\\nserosanguinous drainage. Apply ABD pad as needed. Staples to be\\nremoved in [**1-28**] weeks at follow-up appointment with Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **]. Patient requires aggressive skin care due to\\nmobility deficits.

TPN\\nstarted in ICU, and continued to present day due to poor PO\\nintake. TPN cycled over 12 hours. Electrolytes titrated based on\\ndaily labwork.
